# Calorie-Tracker-App-With-Python-Django-Framework
I thought how about I make a calorie tracker web-app with python Django.
The web-app will track calories intake and the calories consumption.
# Requirements
Python

Django

Django-filter
# Project Setup
I have done this project on windows operating system. If you are on Mac or Linux the
process is almost the same with some command line changes, which you can easily find
from the internet. Go to the location you prefer on your computer from the command line
and start.
